---

## Background
This project stems from my recent firsthand experience in mills where wheat is transformed into flour and various other products. This encounter ignited my curiosity, prompting me to embark on an exhilarating journey to delve into the global scale of wheat cultivation and production. Through this exploration, I aim to uncover insightful, data-driven revelations about the wheat industry.


## About dataset
The quantities of wheat in the following table are in million metric tonnes. All countries with a typical production quantity of at least 2 million metric tonnes are listed below. It contains 42 rows and 27 columns. click  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/wheat-production-statistics) to read more about the data.


## Inquiries for Analysis
1. Identifying the Top Wheat Producers by Country
2. Determining Leading Wheat Producers by Continent
3. Analyzing Time-Series Data for Different Countries
4. Total Wheat Produced per Year
5. Year-over- year Production Analysis

## Skills demonstrated
  - Data Wrangling with Excel
  - Lookup functions
  - Filters
  - Data visualization with Power BI
  - Data Modelling
  - DAX

## Data Cleaning
   After checking for duplicates I observed that the dataset contains none, Although I encountered some data inconsistencies and swiftly resolved them using the 'Find and Replace' function. To better organize the data, I effectively utilized filters to isolate specific subsets for analysis. 
   
   In an effort to streamline the dataset, I identified and removed an extraneous column that was found to be irrelevant. For added context, I integrated a 'Continent' column using the 'VLOOKUP' function, drawing from a separate dataset that listed countries alongside their respective continents. This enrichment enhanced the analysis by providing valuable geographic insights.
